## 🎨 Design Philosophy

My portfolio design reflects current web aesthetics focused on both beauty and usability:

- 🧊 **Glassmorphism** – Clean frosted-glass effects with layered visuals  
- 🌈 **Gradients** – Modern linear transitions for sections and buttons  
- 🌀 **Microinteractions** – Animations that engage without overwhelming  
- 🧱 **Grid & Geometry** – Symmetrical layouts and square-based card systems  
- ♿ **Accessibility First** – Semantic HTML, ARIA tags, and proper contrast
